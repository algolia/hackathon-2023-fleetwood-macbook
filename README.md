## Overview

On November 29th, 2023 Algolia organised an internal hackathon to define what will be the Algolia demo on the new homepage of our website.

We wanted the demo to:
- show how we “understand people and show them what they need”
- be on the homepage, above the fold, and make visitors understand what we're capable of in seconds
- be self-explanatory about what we do
- show how we can help you solve your search problems

## Our demo, "The Versatility of Algolia"

We built our demo to showcase how Algolia is suitable for a range of customers, each with different use cases. So, we build 3 tabs and showed a different use-case in each:

- First, a Netflix-style movie rental site - where speed is critical ⚡️
- Next, a developer's sandbox playground - where fun is required 😆
- Finally, an internal employee directory - where scale is necessary 🏗️

## Run the demo

To run the demo, visit the [CodeSandbox](https://wl3wj9-5173.csb.app/). Alternatively, you can clone the repository and play around with the demo using your own Algolia indices!
